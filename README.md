# KP-Drone

##A Raspberry Pi Zero drone

Drone build based on Raspberry Pi Zero with ROS. 

The flight controller for this project is powered by Linux. Raspberry Pi allow us to program many source of things including loT. The newly Rasperry Pi Zero is small but powerful which is perfectly for this project as it's small. The OS that I will be using is called "[ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/)" (Robotics Operation System)

###Optional but highly recommended

 - 1 x [Quanum Trifecta Mini Foldable Tricopter Expansion Pack](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__80054__Quanum_Trifecta_Mini_Foldable_Tricopter_Expansion_Pack.html)
 - 1 x [50 Pcs Black 8" inch (3x200mm) + 200 Pcs Color 4" inch (3x100mm) Cable ZIP Ties ](http://www.ebay.com/itm/111349885517?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)(This can be purchased from anywhere but I will just put the link where I brought it)
 - 1 x [RadioLink AT10 2.4G 10CH Transmitter w/ R10D Receiver Mode 2 Orange US V4Z9](http://www.ebay.com/itm/401089559250?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)(if you haven't own one then this is a good one with a great price, even though we're going to use autopilot and machine learning to control the drone, it's still fun to have an option of controlling it by a regular RC controller)
 - 1 x [25-Piece Electronics Computer Hand Tool Kit Soldering Iron Pliers Screwdrivers](http://www.ebay.com/itm/361576182376?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT) (Once again, if you already own them then you can ignore. But if you're going to start from scatch like me and are going to purchase this tool kit, I would recommended buy an extra solder(60w) with a smaller tip)
 - 1 x [Yi 4k action camera](https://www.amazon.com/YI-Action-Camera-Night-Black/dp/B01FU9ZIMU)(If you have a GoPro then it's fine but Yi 4k just a budget camera. Moreover, it does have a electronic stalizer which is a HUGE advantage for this camera over GoPro)
 - 1 x [40M Waterproof Case Underwater Protective Diving for Xiaomi Yi 4K Action Camera](http://www.ebay.com/itm/361614900765?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&var=630970188453&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)(If you're going with Yi camera then you should consider getting a case. This is waterproof case although it will protect your camera from falling. I dropped it several times and the case was amazingly protected it well, not a single scratch.
